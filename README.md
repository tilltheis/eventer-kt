# Eventer

Create events, invite friends and party hard!

This is a playground to get to know Kotlin.


## Development

Prerequisites: `docker`, `docker-compose` and `gradle` must be installed.

Start the DB with `docker-compose up`.
Start the app with `./gradlew run`, it will listen on `http://localhost:8080`.

_Hint: For development it's helpful to have ` ./gradlew -t build` running in the background for automatic compilation._
